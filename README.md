# Practical_Machine_Learning-Project

This is a project in Practical_Machine_Learning coruse, provided by Johns Hopkins University.

The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. We used any of the other variables to predict with. 

We should create a report describing how we built the models, how we used cross validation, what we think the expected out of sample error is, and why we made the choices. 

At the end, we also used the best prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
